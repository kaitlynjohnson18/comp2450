# Trial I — *The Foundations Brief*

*Warden of the Foundations · Midterm 1 · 15 %*

Four short answers, one from each floor above. **50–100 words per answer.** No code on this trial (except the lambdas in Q3); just clear thinking.

AI is welcome to *check* your answers; it is not welcome to *write your sentences*. These answers are short enough that an LLM voice is recognisable.

## 1. Floor 0 — ADT

> Your battle's "Use item" menu shows the *currently usable* items in your hero's inventory on this turn. Name the right ADT for that menu. Defend the choice against its closest neighbour (e.g., why `bag` instead of `set`, or `list` instead of `bag`).

(your answer — 50–100 words)

## 2. Floor 1 — search & Big-O

> Your inventory is kept sorted by healing power (in this codebase an item's `value` measures its potency, so `value` plays the healing-power role). The player types `use Healing potion`. Linear or binary search to find it by name? Justify, and give the Big-O for each.

(your answer — 50–100 words)

## 3. Floor 2 — sort & comparators

> Your "Use item" menu must be displayable sorted *either* by healing power (meaning `value`) *or* by weight. Show a one-line comparator (lambda) for each. One sentence on what language feature makes one `std::sort` call serve both orders.

*Note: `Item` has no healing field — an item's `value` measures its potency, so `value` plays the healing-power role here and in your battle.*

```cpp
// by healing power — i.e. by value
auto byValue  = /* your lambda */;

// by weight
auto byWeight = /* your lambda */;
```

(one-sentence answer — what language feature?)

## 4. Floor 3 — templates & exceptions

> Why does `Bag<T>` live in `Bag.h` instead of `Bag.cpp`? And: when the player types `9` for a 4-option menu, where in your code should the validation **throw**, and where should it **catch**?
