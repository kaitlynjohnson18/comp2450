// COMP 2450 — Floor 1 starter
// bestiary/Search.cpp — YOU implement this file.
//
// Four functions to write. Read Search.h for their contracts.
//
// The big idea this week: the same question ("is X in the list?") has
// three implementations with three VERY different Big-O costs. You will
// write all three, race them in `benchmark`, and then argue — in a commit
// message — which one the rest of the game should use. The code is easy.
// The *thinking* is the point.
//
// Tips for the Unsorted Lich:
//   * binarySearch (and binarySearchRecursive) only work if the bestiary
//     is sorted by name.
//   * main.cpp already calls sortBestiary() right after loading,
//     so you can assume the precondition holds when these run.
//   * If you ever doubt, scan the vector and assert it is sorted.
//
// Submit when:  `search Goblin` returns the goblin's stats and `search Ghost`
//               reports "no such creature." Then run `benchmark` and capture
//               the output for your lab-notes.md.

    // TODO Floor 1 (Wed): iterative binary search.
    //   PRECONDITION: bestiary is sorted ascending by name.
    //
    // Think before you type:
    //   - Decide your invariant FIRST, then write code: does `high` mean
    //     "the last valid index" (closed range, [low, high]) or "one past
    //     the last valid index" (half-open, [low, high))? Pick one. Every
    //     off-by-one bug starts with mixing the two.
    //   - `std::size_t` is UNSIGNED. If your search range shrinks to empty
    //     and you compute `high - 1`, does that value wrap around to a
    //     huge number? Try in your head: what happens on `search Aardvark`
    //     when Aardvark comes before every monster? Does your loop end?
    //   - A name comparison has THREE outcomes: equal, less, greater. Each
    //     goes in a different direction. If you collapse two branches into
    //     one (e.g., an `if/else` instead of three cases), you've probably
    //     broken binary search. Write all three explicitly.
    //   - Middle index: `(low + high) / 2` is textbook but can overflow for
    //     huge N. `low + (high - low) / 2` is the safe version. Write the
    //     safe one — it's free, and it's a habit worth building.

    // TODO Floor 1 (Fri): same contract as binarySearch, but recursive.
    //   Recommended pattern: write a `static` helper in this file with extra
    //   (low, high) parameters, and have this public function call it with
    //   the initial range. Same precondition: bestiary must be sorted.
    //
    // Think before you type:
    //   - Every recursion needs a BASE CASE and a RECURSIVE CASE. What is
    //     the smallest range where you already know the answer without
    //     looking further? That is your base case.
    //   - Convince yourself, for each recursive call, that the new range
    //     is a STRICT SUBSET of the old one. If it isn't, you will recurse
    //     until the stack blows up. (Try it at N=100,000 if curious.)
    //   - Why `static` for the helper? It has nothing to do with OOP here.
    //     Look up "internal linkage" — it keeps the helper private to this
    //     .cpp, so two files can have `helper(...)` without a link error.
    //   - After it works: run `benchmark`. Does the recursive version cost
    //     more per call than the iterative one? A little? A lot? Why might
    //     that be? Write the answer in lab-notes.md.

    //     you pick? Run benchmark at N=10 and look at the microseconds.
